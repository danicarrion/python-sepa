# Python SEPA

_Manage SEPA transactions in Python._

## Overview

Python SEPA is a library to help generate ISO 20022 files for SEPA transactions.

Currently, only basic CORE payments (pain.008.001.02) are supported, and with limitations.

No further development is envisioned for this project, given that it already fulfills the author's original (2014) needs and that there are already a few, more complete and generic alternatives out there.
